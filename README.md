:mortar_board: PhD in biology

French - English

Formerly a biology teacher, I am now training in computer science. A vast world of creativity and possibility has opened up to me, and it's amazing ! The sea air and sunshine of Marseille keep me company when I'm coding. I am currently learning C and Python, and my professional goal is to move into cybersecurity.

When I'm not coding, there's a good chance you'll find me reading (science fiction, fantasy, sociology), playing video games, climbing, or drinking a beer while playing board games with my friends.
