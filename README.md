Formerly a biology teacher, I am now training in computer science. A vast world of creativity and possibility has opened up to me, and it's amazing ! The sea air and sunshine of Marseille keep me company when I'm coding. I am currently learning the C language. Once I am comfortable with it, I would like to learn the following languages: C++, Python, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and Rust.

When I'm not coding, there's a good chance you'll find me reading (science fiction, fantasy, sociology), playing video games, climbing, or drinking a beer while playing board games with my friends.
